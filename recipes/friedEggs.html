        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>Here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you fry eggs at home: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack egg into a small bowl.</li>
            <li>In a small nonstick pan over medium heat, 
                melt 1 tsp. butter. Gently swirl to evenly 
                coat pan. If using a metal skillet, heat over
                medium-high heat until a drop of water sizzles 
                when it hits the pan, then add 1 tsp. oil.</li>
            <li>Slip egg into center of pan; season with salt. 
                Cook, undisturbed, until egg white is set on 
                top but yolk is still runny, about 3 minutes. 
                (If desired, use the tines of a fork to break up 
                top of egg white and encourage it to flatten 
                into an even layer.) If the very top of egg white 
                is not set after 3 minutes, add 1 tsp. butter to 
                pan, let melt, then carefully spoon hot melted 
                butter over top of egg white to help it finish cooking.</li>
            <li>Season egg with pepper. Using a flexible rubber spatula, 
                transfer egg to a plate.</li>
        </ol>
